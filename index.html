              The text to the right of this is filler. This is going to be the webpage of Captain Ersatz and his related music projects, web design(?) and etc. Important things to do are to make sure that this page looks sufficiently <strong><span id="vapor">aesthetic</span></strong> and retro, add a guestbook for people to sign when they visit, web ring carousel at the bottom, coding page, and various links to friends and other categories in the links page. Maybe I'll make some reviews for things, idk. Also gotta add tons of gifs and things and a proper bg.

              I used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and laid down a rule that she should not be present with Lucy or think of her illness more than was absolutely required. She assented readily, so readily that I saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life. Van Helsing and I were shown up to Lucy's room. If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday, I was horrified when I saw her to-day. She was ghastly, chalkily pale; the red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of her face stood out prominently; her breathing was painful to see or hear. Van Helsing's face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows converged till they almost touched over his nose.
